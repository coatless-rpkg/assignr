Tools for creating homework assignments and solutions using [_RMarkdown_](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

## Motivation

Writing homework assignments for students in the age of [_RMarkdown_](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) necessitates the creation
of _two_ separate documents -- `assign.Rmd` and `soln.Rmd`.
The goal of `assignr` is to create one document `main.Rmd` that can be broken
apart into the above two documents. Thus, there is no longer a need to 
_copy and paste_ between the `assign` and the `soln` documents as all of the
contents are together in one file.

## Installation

`assignr` is only available via GitHub.

To install the package from GitHub, you can type:

```r
install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("coatless/assignr")
```

## Usage

To use `assignr`, create an Rmd file named `WXYZ-main.Rmd`, where `WXYZ` 
could be `hw00`. Within the file, add to your code chunks one of the following
chunk options:

1. `solution = TRUE`
    - to mark a solution
2. `directions = TRUE` 
    - to indicate directions

When specifying text directions that should not appear in the solution file, use
the latter chunk option, and set the code chunk engine to `asis`, e.g.

````
```{asis name, directions = TRUE}
The goal of the following exercise is... 
```
````

Then, in _R_, run: 

```r
# Render output
assignr("hw00-main.Rmd")
```

Example Output:

```
hw00
├── hw00-assign
│   ├── hw00-assign.Rmd
│   ├── hw00-assign.html
│   ├── hw00-assign.pdf
│   └── hw00-assign.zip
└── hw00-soln
    ├── hw00-soln.Rmd
    ├── hw00-soln.html
    ├── hw00-soln.pdf
    └── hw00-soln.zip
```

Previews of what is contained in each file are shown next.

### Instructor Main

In the main file, denoted as `*-main.Rmd`, all content -- including solutions --
should be placed. As an example of contents, please see the `hw00-main.Rmd`
document that ships with the package.

```r
library("assignr")

file.show(get_example_filepath("hw00-main.Rmd"))
```

# Exercise 1 (Introductory `R`)

```{asis, directions = TRUE}
For this exercise, we will create a couple different vectors.
```

**(a)** Create two vectors `x0` and `x1`. Each should have a
length of 25 and store the following:

- `x0`: Each element should be the value `10`.
- `x1`: The first 25 cubed numbers, starting from `1.` (e.g. `1`, `8`, `27`, et cetera)

```{asis, solution = TRUE}
**Solution:**
```

```{r, solution = TRUE}
x0 = rep(10, 25)
x1 = (1:25) ^ 3
```

### Solutions 

Lastly, we have the assignment rmarkdown file that contains the solutions
and their respective output.
