Version: 0.0.1
Authors@R: c(person("David", "Dalpiaz", email = "dalpiaz2@illinois.edu",

Description: Writing homework assignments for students in the age of 'RMarkdown' 
    necessitates the creation of two separate documents -- assign.Rmd and soln.Rmd.
    The goal of assignr is to create one document main.Rmd that can be broken
    apart into the above two documents. Thus, there is no longer a need to copy
    and paste between the assign and the soln documents as all of the contents
    are together in one file.
