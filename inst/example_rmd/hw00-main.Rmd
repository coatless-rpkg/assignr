# Exercise 1 (Introductory `R`)

```{asis, directions = TRUE}
For this exercise, we will create a couple different vectors.
```

**(a)** Create two vectors `x0` and `x1`. Each should have a
length of 25 and store the following:

- `x0`: Each element should be the value `10`.
- `x1`: The first 25 cubed numbers, starting from `1.` (e.g. `1`, `8`, `27`, et cetera)

```{asis, solution = TRUE}
**Solution:**
```

```{r, solution = TRUE}
x0 = rep(10, 25)
x1 = (1:25) ^ 3
```
